Would it be better to create `@tooltip-line-height` and assign `@line-height-base` to *that* in `variables.less`?"

See if we hardwire tooltip's `line-height` to the `@line-height-base` then we can't control it from `variables.less`.  We have to hack `tooltip.less`."

In my view  `line-height: 1.4;`'s equivalence to `@line-height-base` is coincidental, and changing it to a site-global variable doesn't make it any easier to extend than was the original hard-coded `1.4`."

"
* For context, the custom `source` was done to simplify our directory structure. Having all those extra tooling files (Travis, tests, etc) and `.html` files was kind of confusing."
* Currently, a custom `source` isn't supported by GitHub Pages. You'll get a build error when you try to deploy to Pages right now."
* So, to do this, we have to generate the site one more time (to get the latest changes in our `_site` directory), copy-paste the `_site` contents over to a temporary folder, and then copy-paste that back into the `gh-pages` branch."
"
Rather cumbersome, but until that support is added (and hopefully it'll be soon, there's a PR open), we have to do it this way. #NEWCOMMENT# :thumbsup:"

I'd been thinking about doing this as well.

 #NEWCOMMENT# @cvrebert Yup, I think so.

Always a solid practice <3. #NEWCOMMENT# niiiiiice #NEWCOMMENT# Just coming across this, it needs to be wrapped in a `<p>`. #NEWCOMMENT# The `@brand-primary` could have been simply replaced with the default value, but I wanted the source of the new color value to be left there for context.

"
"
I'd argue no, but I'm the one doing the cursing here, so who am I to answer that? :) #NEWCOMMENT# Just to clarify, I was sincere in my question. I don't see a problem here because I'm doing the cursing—and I quite enjoy it. However, I fully realize that not having a problem myself doesn't mean someone else won't have one. Please know that it's not my intention to offend those people, and that I do not plan on stopping it."
"
It's also worth noting that this is a commit from late 2013—a year and a half ago. There's not much I can do about it now without extensive rewriting of our Git history. #NEWCOMMENT# Looks like the tag itself was updated, but not the URLs. #NEWCOMMENT# @GlobalGISteam Please open an issue with a test case if you're seeing rendering problems on page zooming. #NEWCOMMENT# That parallel doesn't really apply here and isn't always the case. For example, our `.lead` class increases `font-size` and keeps a `line-height: 1.5`. The exact values here were created to achieve a consistent height of multiple elements (like inputs and buttons). That's what determined those values. #NEWCOMMENT# No worries dude, I just wanted you to be aware I changed more stuff :). The copy you used was from me anyway <3. #NEWCOMMENT# Can't recall exactly but I think it may have been missed. #NEWCOMMENT# Agreed, in hindsight we should've communicated this better and bumped the minor version. Apologies for the ongoing hiccup folks <3. #NEWCOMMENT# <3 #NEWCOMMENT# My bad :grin:. Should probably be `30`. #NEWCOMMENT# This is part of v4—go to the v4 pull request or blog post to learn more.

And the description of `b` is slightly off: ""The `b` element represents a span of text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance"" [spec](http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html#the-b-element) #NEWCOMMENT# ""but they don't come with inherent styles anymore"" - suggest removing that part of the sentence because it's not true :) #NEWCOMMENT# Just out of interest, what is the `:last-child` selector for? The example pagination doesn't use it and the ""Next"" link looks like it will just get the `disabled` class when there is no ""Next"" page. So, I've just dropped the `:last-child` selector (because IE8 is choking on it and dropping the whole rule anyway - although IE7 actually splits the selectors and doesn't choke). If you envisaged a use for it, perhaps add `first` and `last` classes? Anyway, just a thought. #NEWCOMMENT# But the last child has the `next` class which also removes the border. So it looks ok to me if you pull the `:last-child` selector out. Are you saying that sometimes the last child won't be the ""Next"" link? A pagination variant not yet in the docs? #NEWCOMMENT# Of course. The example has a `disabled` ""Previous"" link so I was wondering if the idea was to always display them. It sounds like no. And adding an extra class to remove borders on the last element is a bit clunky too I suppose. Nevermind! Thanks #NEWCOMMENT# Nice. BTW, the example file has `column` and `columns` classes alongside every `span*` class. Was that part of an earlier approach? #NEWCOMMENT# Interested to find out what the thinking was that led to this revert. #NEWCOMMENT# In `variables.less` there is: `@gridTotalWidth: @gridRowWidth;` ...so they cancel each other out on this line, meaning it could be reduced to:

    (@gridGutterWidth + @gridColumnWidth) * @columns - @gridGutterWidth #NEWCOMMENT# Don't forget that this probably also requires changes to the Bootstrap JS plugins so that they don't use jQuery's `hide` and `show` methods. Inline styles get trumped by `!important`."

However you still lose the rounded corners in IE 9, as noted in the
change description. I mis-remembered before and said IE 9 didn't
support filters. That may actually not be true, but if it's there it
doesn't support them alongside border radius. (I'm away from my IE 9
box and can't check.)

Not sure what you mean about separate pull requests; this change was
part of the IE compatibility fixes I made before 2.0 shipped.

If you can get hover/active working with filters you're welcome to
try, though it would still be a question about prioritizing rounded
corners or gradients in IE 9.

"
Please, could you care to explain the rationale behind this change?"
"
If the idea was to darken the brand-primary color for links, shouldn't the darkening be applied when setting the `@link-color`?"
"
It seems to me that darkening a hard-coded color (`#428bca`) to get another color (`#337ab7`) doesn't bring any benefit (over directly setting the variable to the dark color value)."
Also, my understanding is that the ""semantic"" for the `@brand-primary` variable is to set it to, well, the brand's primary color, and not to a darkened variation of it."
"
Of course, if I'm customizing/overriding Bootstrap defaults, I can just remove the `darken` function and set the desired value and call it a day. Nothing stops me from doing so, and that would make this little, soft rant something to be discarded without further consideration :) (Maybe that's the answer/rationale I'm looking for? You tell me! ) :)"
"
In other words, why doing:"
```"
@brand-primary: darken(#428bca, 6.5%); // #337ab7"
..."
@link-color: @brand-primary;"
..."
```"
instead of doing:"
```"
@brand-primary: #428bca;"
..."
@link-color: darken(@brand-primary, 6.5%); // #337ab7 ;"
..."
```"
"
Of course, if this darker version of the `@brand-primary` color should be used in other variables (like it's currently used in, for example, `@btn-primary-bg` or `@panel-primary-border`, just to mention two variables that are set to the value of `@brand-primary`), then applying the `darken()` on each variable definition could look like a violation of DRY principle."
But as your commit message reads: _""darken primary blue for accessibility contrast on link colors""_, then I'd say * that this color darkening should only affect the `@link-color` variable (instead of also applying to every other variable that is set to `@brand-primary`)."
"
BTW, as an alternative explanation for this change, I can also understand if you say that it's mostly related to improve accessibility for Bootstrap (the project's theme/branding, not the framework), than as a general improvement on the Bootstrap framework."
 #NEWCOMMENT# What's the rationale behind `line-height-large` being smaller than `line-height-small`?"
It seems counter-intuitive to me. #NEWCOMMENT# @sqal, my guess is that larger font sizes usually require smaller line-heights to keep a good level of readability. Similarly, smaller font sizes require larger line-heights to keep a good level of readability.

"
As for your point ""I don't think that generating a bunch of unused code serves the majority of bootstrap users"", I'm curious about that. Do you mean ""unused in the Bootstrap examples and docs?""  And I say this tongue in cheek, but why not just make this simple go with 1 column so you can get rid of all those unused span3's, 5s, 7s and 9s?   Is 12 col really justified when you're only using span4, span8 and span12?  "
"
All kidding aside, just like Bootstrap doesn't apply all 12 columns of the grid to every page in the docs - you use a span4 here, a span8 there - we want to do the same but with the flexibility of tighter 24-column grid. I know that keeping the Kb low is important, but the grid is so foundational to Bootstrap. For sure, Bootstrap's docs have a great look that works well with wide spacing and large fonts. That doesn't work for many of our projects, because we don't do consumer-focused, public websites."
"
We are focused on enterprise and b2b related stuff; supply chain, inventory management, shipping etc., and suffice it to say that we would definitely benefit from more granularity than 12 columns.  We have a lot of data-rich, repeating elements that benefit from a tighter grid - e.g. widget-like stealth analytics, so we ended up having to create our own ""grid within the grid"". But it feels kind of dirty, and it's a PITA to maintain if we want to keep merging in Bootstrap's awesome enhancements. We'd like to be using Bootstrap's native grid, it's easy to not use all 24 columns if you don't need them. But it's not fun to maintain a grid that isn't natively supported or possible to create by default in Bootstrap. "
"

"
As for your point ""I don't think that generating a bunch of unused code serves the majority of bootstrap users"", I'm curious about that. Do you mean ""unused in the Bootstrap examples and docs?""  And I say this tongue in cheek, but why not just make this simple go with 1 column so you can get rid of all those unused span3's, 5s, 7s and 9s?   Is 12 col really justified when you're only using span4, span8 and span12?  "
"
All kidding aside, just like Bootstrap doesn't apply all 12 columns of the grid to every page in the docs - you use a span4 here, a span8 there - we want to do the same but with the flexibility of tighter 24-column grid. I know that keeping the Kb low is important, but the grid is so foundational to Bootstrap. For sure, Bootstrap's docs have a great look that works well with wide spacing and large fonts. That doesn't work for many of our projects, because we don't do consumer-focused, public websites."
"
We are focused on enterprise and b2b related stuff; supply chain, inventory management, shipping etc., and suffice it to say that we would definitely benefit from more granularity than 12 columns.  We have a lot of data-rich, repeating elements that benefit from a tighter grid - e.g. widget-like stealth analytics, so we ended up having to create our own ""grid within the grid"". But it feels kind of dirty, and it's a PITA to maintain if we want to keep merging in Bootstrap's awesome enhancements. We'd like to be using Bootstrap's native grid, it's easy to not use all 24 columns if you don't need them. But it's not fun to maintain a grid that isn't natively supported or possible to create by default in Bootstrap. "

So I speculate there was some npm weirdness going on. #NEWCOMMENT# Needs a rebase, but lgtm. #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR Yup, found the problem: https://github.com/twbs/gruntworker/issues/6 #NEWCOMMENT# Why? #NEWCOMMENT# The name of the property is `width`, not `Width` #NEWCOMMENT# What about PowerShell? #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR LGTM. #NEWCOMMENT# LGTM #NEWCOMMENT# **See #16663 for further discussion.** #NEWCOMMENT# @lynicidn `bower install 'bootstrap#master'` still works fine. Sounds like there's a bug in the non-Bower tools you're using. Also, you might as well just use [the native composer package](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/composer.json) if you're using composer. #NEWCOMMENT# @lynicidn https://github.com/francoispluchino/composer-asset-plugin/issues/129 #NEWCOMMENT# For posterity:"
Composer Asset Plugin has fixed their bug via https://github.com/francoispluchino/composer-asset-plugin/pull/137 #NEWCOMMENT# What's up with using `site.baseurl` so much? #NEWCOMMENT# @mdo Why is this less than the previous one? #NEWCOMMENT# Would appreciate a more descriptive commit message for this #NEWCOMMENT# This should be in a different commit #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR I'm not near my laptop to confirm, but we shouldn't be using anything in this file anymore and ought to be able to nuke it. #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR Good enough  #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR Confirmed: #17357 #NEWCOMMENT# not relevant to this commit #NEWCOMMENT# @mdo This comment is no longer relevant since you removed the nbsp. #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR We'll also need to exclude jQuery 3 (http://blog.jquery.com/2015/07/13/jquery-3-0-and-jquery-compat-3-0-alpha-versions-released/) since it's not backward-compatible with jQuery 2, is still in alpha, and we haven't tested against it. #NEWCOMMENT# Yeah, and `version 2.x.x` in the error message text. #NEWCOMMENT# @arashataei You would have to write a patch for Mozilla Firefox's rendering engine (named Gecko)."
Doing that is pretty difficult, and besides pointing you to https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Introduction , I can't offer any useful advice. #NEWCOMMENT# Erm, that should have been #17910 instead of #17735. :sweat:  #NEWCOMMENT# Dangit. Good catch. #NEWCOMMENT# 7a85751144ae79ce9a7466e67d19d7103b6e1ddc was close enough :smile:  #NEWCOMMENT# Try clobbering your `node_modules` ? Makes no sense to have `babel-eslint` in v3. #NEWCOMMENT# Agreed... #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR I said nothing in the commit message about having fixed the minification problem; that's still an open issue. #NEWCOMMENT# Rather, applying the `0%` simplification remains an open issue. #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR What issue? #NEWCOMMENT# @fredtitao Read the pull request: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/16430#issuecomment-115419079 #NEWCOMMENT# @kkirsche This commit predates the 1st v4 alpha release, hence the future tense. If you want to go thru and update the tenses, be my guest. #NEWCOMMENT# Ah, now I see the file diff you're referring to. Filed #18216 for this. #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR FYI, it needs to be `[skip sauce]` #NEWCOMMENT# Fixes #18216. #NEWCOMMENT# Cherry-picked from #17327. #NEWCOMMENT# `>= 3` #NEWCOMMENT# @vsn4ik Good catch. Wanna pull request a fix? #NEWCOMMENT# Yeah sure. #NEWCOMMENT# So we're using bitwise operators somewhere? #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR I'm on board with the rest of the ESLint changes. #NEWCOMMENT# So what actually changed here? The diff isn't terribly helpful. #NEWCOMMENT# :+1:  #NEWCOMMENT# The mingw32 stuff here seems extraneous. #NEWCOMMENT# LGTM then. I opened #18392 & #18393 in the hopes of switching this to `2` later. #NEWCOMMENT# Alright then. #NEWCOMMENT# Fixed in c57a9b78de409eb4e929856482ed2a9f89df9f45 #NEWCOMMENT# This name seems way too generic. ""normal"" doesn't suggest any relation to boldness/font-weight specifically. #NEWCOMMENT# Fixed in 28bbf42e26ee321402d956c9f71f9fff7246420e #NEWCOMMENT# Proposed fix: #18452 #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR Yes: 45b318b32f5161c32910d4cf4730200d62934ae4 #NEWCOMMENT# The RubyGem's version doesn't match upstream's, since the gem shipped an extra release; hence why the gem is already on alpha 3 despite upstream only being at alpha 2."
Long-term, once v4 is stable, yes, we should absolutely switch to the templated version at that point. #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR Breaks the test suite; see https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/18890#issuecomment-171878944 et seq. #NEWCOMMENT# X-Ref: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/18569#issuecomment-169541075 #NEWCOMMENT# <3 #NEWCOMMENT# <3<3 #NEWCOMMENT# @mdo But it's not horizontal if someone sets `flex-direction: column`.. #NEWCOMMENT# @XhmikosR Nope: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/click#Internet_Explorer #NEWCOMMENT# Or chunk CSSLint entirely like we did in v4 (#17370). #NEWCOMMENT# IMO, we can't remove the old version like this; it could leak to breaking backward-compatibility. #NEWCOMMENT# Was just presenting more options. I don't speak for anyone besides myself.  #NEWCOMMENT# Yes #NEWCOMMENT# Need to remove the secure env vars related to S3 access #NEWCOMMENT# @julbaxter Because they don't actually link anywhere.

"
As for VoiceOver (assuming OS X), it seems this is a recent change in behavior/bug, as it previously worked fine (see also http://stevefaulkner.github.io/html-mapping-tests/)."
"
As in both cases this seems related to shortcomings/bugs in AT, and since (from experience and talking to AT users) landmark-based navigation is still not prevalent for these users (mainly because many sites don't use landmarks yet, so a chicken/egg situation), I may opt to leave this change as is..."
"
However, thanks for making me go and recheck VO (and find out that it seems to have borked itself in recent updates)"
"
[EDIT] It also seems that VO/iOS behaves correctly and recognises ``<nav>`` as a landmark, so it's definitely a new VO/OS X bug #NEWCOMMENT# I'm guessing that you're overriding the ``display:none`` somehow, then...because once something's ``display:none``'d, any change to ``visibility`` should have no effect. Please provide a live working example (ideally, as a separate issue, please) #NEWCOMMENT# LGTM for what it's worth #NEWCOMMENT# please file a separate issue with a reduced test case showing the problem you're describing, rather than a line note to a commit. #NEWCOMMENT# it's a side effect it seems. however, it's necessary to prevent actual clicking (without having to resort to further JS to suppress the click) #NEWCOMMENT# Wondering if simply moving the `cursor: ...` directive one level up (directly as style rule of `.disabled` rather than the child element itself) would be a low-impact fix. (currently on the road and not in a position to make big changes/run tests locally...but conceptually I *think* that'd work) #NEWCOMMENT# tried a few variations (such as adding `cursor: not-allowed` to the actual `.page-item.disabled`, and leaving `pointer-events: none` on the `.page-item.disabled .page-link`) ... but it seems that basically that doesn't work. you *either* have `cursor:...` *or* `pointer-events: none`. personally, i'd say it's more important to use `pointer-events` to suppress the clickability (in supporting modern browsers) than to show the (at least on windows, extremely colourful and ugly) cursor...and i'd go so far as to say the `cursor` directive should be removed (again, as on windows it looks subjectively horrid) here and for consistency in other places where this is set. thoughts @mdo @cvrebert ?"

Which returns it to the same state it was before the body had the padding. Like elithrar above, I am not sure if this is an issue, but for ""wrappers"" that don't have a width or margin set to them, they need that -15px side margins to touch the ""edges"" of the browser, and then some sort of inner padding to keep content from touching the edges as well, which it didn't need before since the rows had the margins to keep everything away from the edges."
"
You can see my development site I update each day with the new commits to see what happens, the neon green squares show the body padding pushing in the wrappers. The red and gray wrappers would touch the edges before. The negative margin fixes it, but I am not sure if that's how you want people using full width wrappers.

I'm not sure if I'm witnessing a bug or not, but I'm experiencing a regression with my upgrade from 3.2 to 3.3.6."
"
Basically, I have a .form-control.btn.btn-danger[disabled] and in 3.2 it shows its default color(shaded/darkened red) but in 3.3.6 the background disappears (only if the button is a .form-control also)"
"
My understanding is:"
"
.form-control resets the background color (to grey)."
"
In bootstrap 3.2 .btn-danger[disabled] redeclares the background color property which gives the correct results."
"
In bootstrap 3.3.6 .btn-danger[disabled] is missing. I believe this is due to the removal of the '&' (call it a 'pass through') of line 45(from version 3.2) above."
"
Now the question remains if this behavior conflicts with your intentions for this commit or not? And if, in general, this layered redeclaration of background colors indicates a deeper architectural issue but I'm not familiar with the code enough to have an opinion on that."
"
Have you any thoughts, (it's easy to work around this anyway!)"
Thanks,"

At Bootstrap's default @font-size-base these two calculations both come out to 34px, but I need @font-size-base=12px, @line-height-base=1.8334 (so @line-height-computed=22px) and @padding-base-vertical=0px.
